# BATTLESHIP
## Created by Mike & Dylan

### Instructions
You will play against the super advanced Turing 6100 Super Computer.
First you will place your Cruiser ship which has a length of 3.
Next you will place your Submarine ship which has a length of 2.

Once you place your pieces Turing 6100 will do the same.
You will then take turns firing upon coordinates until all ships on either side are sunk.
A ship has health equal to its length.
All ships can only be placed within the grid and either horizontally or vertically.

Be wary as Turing 6100 has been calibrated to enjoy the thrill of the win.

When ready run the runner file and let the game begin.

### Reflection
1. When approaching this design we took it step by step with what we needed for this project to be complete. We built out a game class to take in all of our classes and begin rendering how this would be displayed. We walked through each componant that we would need to make this game functional from inital set up, placing ships, and taking shots all returning with correct display messages. Once we had a functional game we added in some fun Turing 6100 responses.
For problem solving we did add a game spec that was able to test some functionality without fully rendering the game to ensure the computer was correctly placing ships in a valid area.
2. If we had one more day to work on this project we would have loved to get into Iteration 4 of the project. We would have liked the player to be able to create their own ships and adjust the board size. This probably would take more then a day but we would have at least wanted to build the framework to get it going.
3. We used several different pairing techniques over the course of this project. We spent a good amount of time doing Driver Navigator which allowed us to problem solve together, especially when we ran into some issues with our game class not rendering our board correctly. This was also important when it came to the build out of our game class. Over the holiday weeeknd we found time to check in and really outline what we were looking to accomplish and who can do what. We stayed in touch with each other through the course of this project from Zoom, huddles, and slack. 
4. Most of our feedback was shared with each other in the moment. We also used comments in our PRs to add feedback as well.
